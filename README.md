# Hanoi-Tower-GameSimulation
This is a Java program that simulates the Hanoi Tower game. The Hanoi Tower game is a mathematical puzzle that consists of three rods and a number of disks of different sizes, which can slide onto any rod. The puzzle starts with the disks in a neat stack in ascending order of size on one rod, the smallest at the top, thus making a conical shape.

The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following simple rules:

Only one disk can be moved at a time.
Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty rod.
No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.

Running the Program
To run the program, simply compile and run the HanoiTowerGame.java file. The program does not require any external dependencies or libraries.

When the program starts, it will prompt the user to enter the number of disks they wish to use for the game. Once the user enters an integer, the program will simulate solving the puzzle.
